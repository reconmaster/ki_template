If I had an hour to solve a problem I'd spend 55 minutes thinking
about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions.

* Introduction
I'm testing some new ideas using my [[http://www.andrewmichaeldavis.com/org-mode/2016/03/26/bring-org-to-the-web.html][research methodologies]] that I
honed at the [[http://medicalphysics.uchicago.edu/index.html][University of Chicago]]. I refined these ideas while
working at [[https://istar.jhu.edu/][Johns Hopkins University]]. However I've now realized that
these foundations began with my undergraduate education at [[http://unc.edu/][UNC]], [[https://duke.edu/][Duke]],
and the [[https://bristol.ac.uk/][University of Bristol]].

The real secret at work here is that it is important to design your
problem correctly if you want to find anything useful. Otherwise you
are simply wasting your [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time][time]].

Not only that, I've got some tricks hidden in here that I picked up
while studying the ancient ways of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aikido][合気道]]. Intrigue me enough with
your propositions to my axioms of research, and I'll start to unlock
very interesting problems for us to solve together.

Feel free to copy this conceptual framework for designing optimization
problems that result in useful learning for the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human][Human]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species][species]].
